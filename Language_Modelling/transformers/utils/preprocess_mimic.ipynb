anterior longitudinal ligament. lucency in the right posterior c1 ring may represent a chronic injury. likely old avulsion fracture at t2 pedicle on the left. ossification of both anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments with compromise of the central spinal canal. degenerative disease is further described above. ct abdomen/pelvis () impression: no acute injuries in the chest, abdomen, or pelvis. three discrete pleural fluid collections in the right hemithorax, likely pseudotumors. small hypodense lesion in the pancreatic body is of unclear etiology, may represent pseudicyst or cystic tumor. further evaluation with mri may be performed on a non- emergent basis. bilateral renal cysts. foley catheter balloon inflated within the prostatic urethra. recommend emergent repositioning. ct sinus/maxillofacial () bilateral nasal bone fractures. left frontal scalp hematoma with preseptal soft tissue swelling. question foreign body anterior to the left globe. recommend

head ct () no acute intracranial hemprrhage. left frontal scalp hematoma. nasal bone fractures. recommend correlation with report from facial bone ct scan. lucency in the right posterior ring of cplease refer to dedeicated ct c-spine for further detail. left cerebellar encephalomalacia, likely due to old infarction. chest the dobbhoff tube passes below the diaphragm with its tip most likely terminating in the stomach. the bilateral pacemakers are demonstrated with one lead terminating in right atrium and three leads terminating in right ventricle. the patient is in mild pulmonary edema with no change in the loculated pleural fluid within the major fissure. ct head a tiny amount of intraventricular hemorrhage layers along the occipital horns of the ventricles bilaterally. recommend followp imaging. left frontal scalp hematoma has decreased in size. unchanged left cerebellar encephalomalacia. nasal bone fractures are better evaluated on dedicated maxillofacial ct. right shoulder x-ray () mild glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis. nonspecific ossification projecting over the upper margin of the scapular body and adjacent to the lesser tuberosity. diagnostic considerations include the sequela of chronic calcific bursitis, intraarticular bodies, and/or calcific tendinitis of the subscapularis tendon. increased opacity projecting over the right hemithorax and minor fissure, better delineated on recent chest radiographs and chest ct right upper extremity ultrasound () deep venous thrombosis in the right axillary vein, extending proximally into the right subclavian vein, and distally to involve the brachial veins, portion of the basilic vein, and the right cephalic vein. likely 2.0 cm left axillary lymph node, with unusual son features somewhat suspicious for malignancy. followup ultrasound is recommended in 4 weeks, and fna/biopsy may be considered at that time if no interval improvement. ct abdomen with iv contrast: there are small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions, on the right with a loculated appearance. there is associated compressive atelectasis. the visualized portion of the heart suggests mild cardiomegaly. there is no pericardial effusion. there is a 9-mm hypoattenuating, well-defined lesion in the left lobe of the liver (2:12) too small to accurately characterize but statistically most likely representing a cyst. there are bilateral, partially exophytic renal cysts. the spleen is normal in size. there is a 5-mm hypoattenuating focus in the pancreatic body, most likely representing focal fat. the gallbladder and adrenal glands are unremarkable. an ng tube terminates in the stomach. there is no ascites. the large and small bowel loops appear unremarkable without wall thickening or pneumatosis. oral contrast material has passed into the ascending colon without evidence of obstruction. there is no ascites and no free air. there is a small pocket of air in the left rectus muscle, tracking over a distance of approximately 10 cm. ct pelvis with iv contrast: the pelvic small and large bowel loops, collapsed bladder containing foley catheter and seminal vesicles appear unremarkable. the prostate is enlarged, measuring 5.9 cm in transverse diameter. the rectum contains a moderate amount of dried stool. there is no free air or free fluid. bone windows: no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions. there is dish of the entire visualized thoracolumbar spine. there also are degenerative changes about the hip joints with large acetabular osteophytes. impression: stable bilateral pleural effusions, loculated on the right. new focus of air tracking within the left rectus muscle with associated tiny amount of extraperitoneal air (2:53). no associated stranding or fluid collection. please correlate clinically if this could be iatrogenic, such as due to s.q. injections. 5-mm hypoattenuating focus in the pancreatic body. this could represent focal fat, although a cystic tumor cannot be excluded. if this is of concern, then mri is again recommended for further evaluation. hypoattenuating focus in the left lobe of the liver, too small to accurately characterize. bilateral partially exophytic renal cysts. moderate amount of dried stool within the rectum. a wet read was placed and the pertinent findings were discussed by doctor with doctor at 11:30 p.m. on . video oropharyngeal swallow findings: real-time video fluoroscopic evaluation was performed after oral administration of thin and puree consistency of barium, in conjunction with the speech pathologist. oral phase: normal bolus formation, bolus control, ap tongue movement, oral transit time, and no oral cavity residue. pharyngeal phase: there is normal swallow initiation and velar elevation. there is mild-to-moderate impairment of laryngeal elevation with absent epiglottic deflection. there is moderate-to-severe increase in pharyngeal transit time. there is residue in the valleculae and piriform sinuses with moderate impairment of bolus propulsion. there was aspiration of both thin and puree barium. impression: aspiration of thin liquids and puree. for additional information, please see the speech and swallow therapist's report from the same day. ct head w/out: findings: there is a small amount of blood layering in the occipital horns of both lateral ventricles, unchanged though not as dense given evolution. no new hemorrhage is identified. the ventricles, cisterns, and sulci are enlarged secondary to involutional change. periventricular white matter hyperdensities are sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemia. encephalomalacia in the left cerebellar hemisphere secondary to old infarction is unchanged. the osseous structures are unremarkable. the visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. skin staples are noted along the superior- posterior neck secondary to recent spinal surgery. impression: no interval change with a very small intraventricular hemorrhage. no discharge labs as patient cmo. brief hospital course: mr. was seen at after his fall from a height of approximatly 10 feet. ct scans of his chest, abdomen and pelvis were negative for pathology. ct scan of his c-spine showed fracture of anterior and posterior elements at c6- he was also shown to have a right nasal bone fracture. c-spine fracture: mr. two surgical procedures to stabilized his c-spine. : anterior cervical decompression/fusion at c6- : cervical laminectomy c6-c7 & t1 with posterior cervical arthrodesis c4-t he tolerated the procedures well. he was extubated without complication. after his surgical procedures, mr. was transfered to the medicine service at for his medical care. while on the medicine service, patient was found to be persistently aspirating and failed his speech and swallow evaluation. patient and family were not interested in an ng tube or peg for nutrition. patient also developed a venous clot of the right upper extremity and the decision was made to not proceed with medical treatment. goals of care were changed to comfort measures only. a foley was placed after patient had difficulty with urinary retention and straight cathing. a palliative care consult was obtained for symptom management and patient was discharged to hospice with morphine, olanzapine, and a foley in place for symptomatic relief. medications on admission: coumadin seroquel docusate metoprolol folate lovastatin captopril asa ipratroium inhaler ferrous sulfate furosemide citalopram isosorbide meprazole

medicine history of present illness: this is an 81-year-old female with a history of emphysema (not on home o2), who presents with three days of shortness of breath thought by her primary care doctor to be a copd flare. two days prior to admission, she was started on a prednisone taper and one day prior to admission she required oxygen at home in order to maintain oxygen saturation greater than 90%. she has also been on levofloxacin and nebulizers, and was not getting better, and presented to the emergency room. in the emergency room, her oxygen saturation was 100% on cpap. she was not able to be weaned off of this despite nebulizer treatment and solu-medrol 125 mg iv x review of systems is negative for the following: fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, night sweats, change in weight, gastrointestinal complaints, neurologic changes, rashes, palpitations, orthopnea. is positive for the following: chest pressure occasionally with shortness of breath with exertion, some shortness of breath that is positionally related, but is improved with nebulizer treatment. past medical history: copd. last pulmonary function tests in demonstrated a fvc of 52% of predicted, a fev1 of 54% of predicted, a mmf of 23% of predicted, and a fev1:fvc ratio of 67% of predicted, that does not improve with bronchodilator treatment. the fvc, however, does significantly improve with bronchodilator treatment consistent with her known reversible air flow obstruction in addition to an underlying restrictive ventilatory defect. the patient has never been on home oxygen prior to this recent episode. she has never been on steroid taper or been intubated in the past. lacunar cva. mri of the head in demonstrates mild degree of multiple small foci of high t2 signal within the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres as well as the pons, in the latter region predominantly to the right of midline. the abnormalities, while nonspecific in etiology, are most likely secondary to chronic microvascular infarction. there is no mass, lesion, shift of the normal midline strictures or hydrocephalus. the major vascular flow patterns are preserved. there is moderate right maxillary, moderate bilateral ethmoid, mild left maxillary, minimal right sphenoid, and frontal sinus mucosal thickening. these abnormalities could represent an allergic or some other type of inflammatory process. additionally noted is a moderately enlarged subtotally empty sella turcica. angina: most recent stress test was in going for four minutes with a rate pressure product of 10,000, 64% of maximum predicted heart rate without evidence of ischemic ekg changes or symptoms. the imaging portion of the study demonstrated no evidence of myocardial ischemia and a calculated ejection fraction of 84%.

pulmicort nebulizer b.i.d. albuterol nebulizer q.prn. lexapro 10 mg q.d. protonix 40 mg q.d. aspirin 81 mg q.d. allergies: norvasc leads to lightheadedness and headache. family history: noncontributory. social history: lives with her husband, doctor an eminent pediatric neurologist at . the patient is a prior smoker, but has not smoked in over 10 years. she has no known alcohol use and she is a full code. physical exam at time of admission: blood pressure 142/76, heart rate 100 and regular, respirations at 17-21, and 97% axillary temperature. she was saturating at 100% on cpap with dry mucous membranes. an elderly female in no apparent distress. pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. extraocular movements are intact. oropharynx difficult to assess due to cpap machine. no evidence of jugular venous pressure, however, the strap from the cpap machine obscures the neck exam. cranial nerves ii through xii are grossly intact. neck is supple without lymphadenopathy. heart exam: tachycardic, regular, obscured by loud bilateral wheezing with increase in the expiratory phase as well as profuse scattered rhonchi throughout the lung fields. positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended, obese, no masses. mild edema of the lower extremities without clubbing or cyanosis, no rashes. there is a right hand hematoma. strength is assessed as in the lower extremities, in the upper extremities with a normal mental status and cognition. laboratory studies: white count 19, hematocrit 41, platelets chem-7: 127, 3.6, 88, 29, 17, 0.6, troponin was negative. cks were negative times three. initial blood gas showed a ph of 7.4, po2 of 66, pco2 of chest x-ray demonstrates a moderate sized hiatal hernia, segmental atelectasis, left lower lobe infiltrate versus segmental atelectasis. ekg shows normal sinus rhythm at 113 beats per minute, normal axis, no evidence of st-t wave changes. brief summary of hospital course: copd/dyspnea/pneumonia: the patient was initially placed on an aggressive steroid taper and admitted to the medical intensive care unit due to her difficulty with oxygenation despite cpap machine. she was also given nebulizer treatments q.4h. as well as chest pt. the nebulizers were increased to q.1h. due to the fact that she continued to have labored breathing. due to persistent respiratory failure and labored breathing, the patient was intubated on in order to improve oxygenation, ventilation, and ability to suction. a bronchoscopy was performed on , which demonstrated marked narrowing of the airways with expiration consistent with tracheomalacia. on , two silicone stents were placed, one in the left main stem (12 x 25 and one in the trachea 16 x 40) by doctor under rigid bronchoscopy with general anesthesia. on , the patient was extubated to a cool mist shovel mask and her oxygen was titrated down to 2 liters nasal cannula at which time she was transferred to the medical floor. on the medical floor, the steroids were weaned to off on , and the patient was saturating at 97% on 2 liters, 92% on room air. on , the patient was seen again by the interventional pulmonology service, who agreed that she looked much improved and recommended that she go to pulmonary rehabilitation with followup within six weeks' time status post placement of stents in respiratory failure. cardiovascular: the patient was ruled out for a mi. she did have another episode on the medical floor of chest pain, which showed no evidence of ekg changes and negative troponin, negative cks x she was continued on aspirin, imdur, and diltiazem for rate control per her outpatient regimen. hypertension: she was maintained on diltiazem and hydrochlorothiazide with adequate blood pressure control and normalization of electrolytes. hematuria: the patient had intermittent hematuria likely secondary to foley placement. the foley catheter was discontinued on . she had serial urinalyses, which were all negative for signs of infection. hyperglycemia: patient was placed on insulin-sliding scale due to hyperglycemia, which was steroid induced. this worked quite well and her glucose came back to normal levels once the steroids were tapered to off. leukocytosis: patient did have a profound leukocytosis of 20 to 22 during much of her hospital course. as the steroids were tapered to off, her white blood cell count on was 15, it was felt that the leukocytosis was secondary to both steroids as well as question of a left lower lobe pneumonia. for the left lower lobe pneumonia, the patient had initially received a course of levofloxacin 500 p.o. q.d. from to . this was restarted on for an additional seven day course given the fact that she still had the leukocytosis and still had marked rales at the left lower lobe. hypothyroidism: the patient was continued on outpatient medical regimen. depression: the patient was continued on lexapro per outpatient regimen. it is recommended that she follow up with a therapist as an outpatient due to the fact that she did have a blunted affect throughout much of the hospital course, and did appear clinically to be depressed. prophylaxis: she was maintained on proton-pump inhibitor with subq heparin. sore throat: the patient did have a sore throat for much of the hospital course post extubation. this was treated with cepacol lozenges as well as kbl liquid (a solution containing kaopectate, bismuth, and lidocaine) at bedtime. communication/code status: the patient was full code throughout her hospital course, and communication was maintained with the patient and her husband. muscle weakness: the patient did have profound muscle weakness and was evaluated by physical therapy, and was found to have impaired functional mobility, impaired musculoskeletal performance, impaired gas exchange, impaired endurance, impaired ventilation, and needed help with supine to sit. however, she was able to tolerate sitting in a chair for approximately one hour. on motor exam, her flexors and extensors of the lower extremities were at the knee, at the ankle, at the elbows, and hips. it was felt that this weakness was most likely due to a combination of steroid myopathy as well as muscle atrophy secondary to deconditioning after a prolonged hospital course. speech/swa\""
